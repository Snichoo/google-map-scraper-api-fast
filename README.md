# Google Maps Business Scraper API

This project is a FastAPI-based Google Maps Business Scraper that allows you to search for business information (such as name, address, website, and phone number) within a specified location. It ensures that the results are accurate by filtering out businesses outside of the specified location. The API is ready to be deployed on platforms like Render.com, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or AWS.
